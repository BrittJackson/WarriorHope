This was a two semester long senior project. It is a JavaScript based mental health web application designed for military servicemembers and veterans. The application allows for users to anonymously chat in both a private forum and during scheduled live chat sessions. Mental health resources are available 24/7 including the Suicide Prevention Hotline. 

## Description
To use the application, all users must register. Before an account can be created, the user's military/veteran status must be verified through a simulated version of the third-party API ID.me. Upon verification, users create a username and password. All users must agree to the terms and conditions to continue. In order to better serve users, all users must complete a mental health assessment questionnaire. This questionnaire was created using the American Psychological Association's mental health assessments. A general assessment is first given and based upon the responses given, the user will then be given a more tailored questionnaire. After completing the second assessment, the user will be assigned a group with users with similar symptoms. Responses are not stored and are used solely for the purpose of group placement. No diagnosis is given and groups are referenced by number only. No personally identifiable information is stored. If the user is dissatisfied with group placement or the user's mental health status has changed, the assessment may be retaken.
